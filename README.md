# INDADD - SQL Queries
Schlepp-adoo Event Management

up walking and racing events and to provide all the logistical support needed. The company’s
services are packaged, and contracts are taken out by external clients such as charities who want
to raise funds.

SQL is based on this scenario, so I have made tables for clients, and other entities related to the event.
